# Overview

This repository includes the code for reproducing our results in "Graph Neural Networks for Road Safety Modeling: Datasets and Evaluations for Accident Analysis." We document the code for collecting our dataset and the implementation of GNNs for predicting the accident labels, including

- Easy-to-use dataset loader for convenient data loading, fully compatible with the graph deep learning framework, [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Example code scripts for training and evaluating graph neural networks on our datasets.
- Detailed documentation on the data collection process using publicly available sources, resulting in 9 million accident records gathered from 8 states across the US. [Link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/privateurl.xhtml?token=add1d658-0e71-4007-9735-7976efb8de5e) to download our processed data files.

### Quick Start

We provide a quick overview of how to use our package for analyzing traffic accidents on road networks. We describe the usage of our easy-to-use data loader, named `TrafficAccidentDataset` which loads the road network in the data format of Pytorch Geometric. Then, we can use a few lines of code with `load_monthly_data(year, month)` to load the accident labels and network features for a particular month. Our code automatically downloads datasets into the `/ml_for_road_safety/data/` folder. To run these commands, one can also manually download the zip file for that state from the [data link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/privateurl.xhtml?token=add1d658-0e71-4007-9735-7976efb8de5e), unzip this file under the `/ml_for_road_safety/data/` folder.

```python
from ml_for_road_safety import TrafficAccidentDataset

# Creating the dataset as PyTorch Geometric dataset object
dataset = TrafficAccidentDataset(state_name = "MA")

# Loading the accident records and traffic network features of a particular month
data = dataset.load_monthly_data(year = 2022, month = 1)

# Pytorch Tensors storing the list of edges with accidents and accident numbers
accidents, accident_counts = data["accidents"], data["accident_counts"]

# Pytorch Tensors of node features, edge list, and edge features
x, edge_index, edge_attr = data["x"], data["edge_index"], data["edge_attr"]
```

With these functions, you can split the datasets into different months for training and evaluation. Additionally, we provide an `Evaluator` module that can be easily integrated into your training or test loop:

```python
from ml_for_road_safety import Evaluator

# Get an evaluator for accident prediction, e.g., the regression task. 
evaluator = Evaluator(type = "regression")

# Iterating over months in a period of time for training
for month in train_months:
    ...
    pred_accident_counts = model(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
    # Compute the prediction loss
    loss = evaluator.criterion(pred_accident_counts, true_accident_counts)
    
# Iterating over months in a period of time for testing
for month in test_months:
    ...
    # Compute the prediction performance
    pred_accident_counts = model(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
    results_dict = evaluator.eval(pred_accident_counts, true_accident_counts)
    print(results_dict['MAE'])
```
